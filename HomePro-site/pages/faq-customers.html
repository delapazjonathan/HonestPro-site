            HonestPro is built to feel calmer and more focused than the usual
            “fill this form and brace yourself” experience. Here’s what that
            means in practice.

                <p>
                  You tell us what you need once, using a short form. We use
                  that information to match you with a small, relevant group of
                  pros in your area — usually up to a few, not dozens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Those pros can then contact you based on the preferences you
                  choose (call, text, email, and when it’s okay to reach out).
                  You compare your options and decide if you want to hire
                  someone or not. There’s no obligation to move forward.

              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                  No. HonestPro is free for customers. Pros pay for access to
                  leads using a credit system, which helps keep the platform
                  running and encourages serious pros to participate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You’re not charged just for sending a request, and you’re not
                  charged by HonestPro if you hire a pro through the platform.

                <p>
                  We cap how many pros can see each request so you’re not
                  overwhelmed. The goal is to connect you with a small group of
                  solid options — usually up to a few pros — instead of a long
                  list all trying to call you at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This helps you compare in a focused way instead of sorting

                <p>
                  We don’t sell or blast your information to a giant list of

                <p>
                  You’ll also be able to indicate how you prefer to be
                  contacted and what times are okay for pros to reach out.
                  That way, they’re not just calling whenever they feel like it.

                <p>
                  You are never obligated to hire anyone. If none of the pros
                  feel like the right fit, you can choose not to move forward,
                  or you can submit a new request later if your needs change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the platform grows, we’ll keep improving the matching so
                  that your initial options feel better and better over time.

              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                  Yes. You should be able to close a request once you’ve found
                  someone, decided to wait, or no longer need the work done.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the customer dashboard rolls out, you’ll see options to
                  mark requests as completed, closed, or no longer needed so
                  pros know to stop reaching out.

                  We use your information to match you with relevant pros inside

                <p>
                  During early testing, you may be able to submit a request

                </p>
                <p>
                  As the platform grows, having an account will let you log in
                  to see your requests, message pros more easily, and track past
                  jobs in one place.

                <p>
                  Response time can vary based on the type of job and how busy
                  pros are, but the goal is for you to start hearing from pros
                  in a reasonable window — often within the same day for common
                  services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During early launch, we’ll keep a close eye on this so we can

                  We’re starting with practical, real-world help: painting,

                  similar projects around your home or property.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As we grow, we’ll expand into things like tutors, lessons,
                  music and creative services, tax prep, and more. The idea is
                  that you can use the same simple request flow for many parts
                  of your life.

                <p>
                  That’s the goal. As the platform rolls out, you’ll be able to
                  mark a job as completed and leave feedback about your
                  experience with a pro. This helps other customers and also
                  helps us highlight the pros who are doing great work.

                <p>
                  Until that’s built in, we may follow up directly to ask how
