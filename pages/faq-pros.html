            If you’ve used other lead platforms, you’ve probably asked some of
            these before. Here’s how HonestPro approaches them.
          </p>

          <div class="faq-grid">
            <!-- Getting started -->

              <summary class="faq-summary">
                How does HonestPro actually work for pros?
              </summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                  You set up a profile with your services and service area, load
                  credits on your account, and then receive leads that match what
                  you do and where you work. For each customer request, we send
                  it to a small group of pros — not a huge list — so you’re not
                  buried in a 20+ person bidding war.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You’ll see job details, location, timing, and basic customer
                  notes before you spend time quoting, and over time you’ll be
                  able to track how those leads turn into real jobs.
                </p>
              </div>

                What kinds of pros is HonestPro built for?
              </summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                  We’re starting with home services and skilled pros: painters,
                  cleaners, handypeople, mobile detailers, and similar trades in
                  your area. From there, we’ll expand into more services like
                  tutors, lessons, tax help, and other side-hustle or small
                  business services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whether you’re working solo or running a small crew, HonestPro
                  is designed to feel like a long-term source of leads, not just
                  a quick spike.
                </p>
              </div>

              <summary class="faq-summary">
                How do credits and lead costs work?
              </summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                  Instead of random per-lead charges, you buy credits in advance.
                  Each lead uses a set number of credits based on its type and
                  value. Smaller jobs use fewer credits; bigger, higher-value
                  jobs can use more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You’ll always see the lead cost clearly, and you’ll be able to
                  choose a starting level that matches your pace — from trying a
                  few leads to keeping a steady pipeline full.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The exact credit amounts can evolve as we see what works best
                  for real pros. The structure stays the same; the numbers can be
                  tuned with feedback.
                </p>

              </summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                  We cap how many pros see a given lead so it doesn’t feel like
                  a race to the bottom. The goal is “a small, fair group of
                  pros” — enough competition to keep things honest, but not so
                  many that you’re one of dozens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is one of the core differences from other platforms: we
                  care more about realistic opportunities than sheer volume.
                </p>

                What happens if a lead is obviously bad or fake?
              </summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                  If a lead clearly doesn’t meet our standards — fake contact
                  info, nonsense details, or a job that’s completely different
                  than what was described — you’ll be able to flag it for
                  review. We’ll look at those cases for potential credit
                  adjustments or returns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We’ll be especially hands-on about this during early testing,
                  so the system gets better as more real examples come in.
                </p>

                What if I don’t win the job — do I still lose all the credits?
              </summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                  When a lead is real and you had a fair shot at the work, you
                  are paying for that opportunity — not a guaranteed job. That’s
                  true of any lead system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over time, our goal is to reward pros who stick with the
                  platform through things like partial credit returns, loyalty
                  perks, or bonuses for consistent activity. The exact rules will
                  be shaped with feedback from real pros, not just theory.

              </summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                  On each lead, you’ll see the customer’s preferred contact
                  method and time window — for example “text only, evenings,” or
                  “call during normal business hours,” or whatever times they’ve
                  selected to be contacted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This helps you reach out in a way that feels respectful and
                  is more likely to get a response.
                </p>

              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                  No. HonestPro is not built around selling or sharing your
                  information with random third parties. Your profile is used to
                  match you with customer requests inside the platform — not to
                  build a separate list that gets shared or resold.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The same goes for customer data: we focus on matching the right
                  pros to the right jobs, not building a data business on the
                  side.

                <p>
                  Your dashboard is where you’ll eventually see your active
                  leads, past jobs, and credit usage in one place. You’ll be
                  able to track which leads turned into real work and which
                  areas are most profitable for you.
                </p>

              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                  Yes. As we roll out the full experience, you’ll be able to
                  adjust your service areas, categories, and credit reloads to
                  match your schedule. If you’re booked out, you should be able
                  to slow things down; if you want to grow, you can scale up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During early testing, some of this may be done with our help
                  directly, and later you’ll manage more of it in your dashboard.
